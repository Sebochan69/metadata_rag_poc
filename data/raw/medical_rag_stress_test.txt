Comprehensive Medical Compendium for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Stress Testing

Purpose of This Document

This document is intentionally long, dense, technical, and
information-rich. It is designed to push a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system to its limits in terms of: - Chunking strategy -
Embedding quality - Semantic recall - Long-context reasoning -
Cross-section reference resolution - Medical terminology understanding

The content below spans multiple domains of medicine, including anatomy,
physiology, pathology, pharmacology, diagnostics, public health, ethics,
and emerging research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Human Anatomy Overview

1.1 Cardiovascular System

The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood, and blood
vessels. Its primary function is to transport oxygen, nutrients,
hormones, and waste products throughout the body.

Key components: - Heart (atria, ventricles, valves) - Arteries (elastic,
muscular) - Veins - Capillaries

Clinical relevance: - Hypertension results from increased systemic
vascular resistance. - Atherosclerosis involves lipid deposition within
arterial walls. - Myocardial infarction occurs due to ischemia of
cardiac muscle.

1.2 Nervous System

The nervous system is divided into: - Central Nervous System (CNS):
brain and spinal cord - Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): cranial and
spinal nerves

Subdivisions: - Somatic nervous system - Autonomic nervous system
(sympathetic and parasympathetic)

Diseases: - Parkinson’s disease: dopaminergic neuron degeneration -
Alzheimer’s disease: amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles - Multiple
sclerosis: autoimmune demyelination

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Physiology and Homeostasis

2.1 Cellular Metabolism

Cells generate energy primarily through: - Glycolysis - Krebs cycle -
Oxidative phosphorylation

ATP is the universal energy currency of the cell.

2.2 Endocrine Regulation

Hormones regulate growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

Examples: - Insulin lowers blood glucose by increasing cellular
uptake. - Glucagon raises blood glucose via glycogenolysis. - Cortisol
modulates stress response and inflammation.

Disorders: - Diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 - Cushing syndrome -
Addison disease

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Pathology

3.1 Inflammation

Inflammation is the body’s response to injury or infection.

Cardinal signs: - Rubor - Calor - Tumor - Dolor - Functio laesa

Chronic inflammation is linked to: - Cancer - Cardiovascular disease -
Autoimmune disorders

3.2 Neoplasia

Neoplasia refers to abnormal tissue growth.

Benign vs malignant: - Benign tumors are localized - Malignant tumors
invade and metastasize

Hallmarks of cancer: - Sustained proliferative signaling - Evasion of
apoptosis - Angiogenesis - Immune evasion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Pharmacology

4.1 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics describes how the body handles a drug.

ADME: - Absorption - Distribution - Metabolism - Excretion

4.2 Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamics focuses on drug effects on the body.

Concepts: - Receptor binding - Agonists vs antagonists - Dose-response
relationships

Drug classes: - Antibiotics (beta-lactams, macrolides) -
Antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, ARBs) - Analgesics (NSAIDs, opioids)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Diagnostics and Imaging

5.1 Laboratory Medicine

Common tests: - Complete blood count (CBC) - Basic metabolic panel
(BMP) - Liver function tests (LFTs)

Interpretation requires clinical correlation.

5.2 Imaging Modalities

-   X-ray
-   CT scan
-   MRI
-   Ultrasound
-   PET scan

Each modality has strengths and limitations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Infectious Diseases

6.1 Bacterial Infections

Examples: - Tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) - Streptococcal
pharyngitis - Sepsis

Antibiotic resistance is a major global concern.

6.2 Viral Infections

Examples: - Influenza - HIV - COVID-19

Vaccination remains the most effective preventive strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Public Health and Epidemiology

7.1 Epidemiological Measures

-   Incidence
-   Prevalence
-   Mortality rate
-   Case fatality rate

7.2 Disease Prevention

Levels: - Primary prevention (vaccination) - Secondary prevention
(screening) - Tertiary prevention (rehabilitation)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Medical Ethics

Core principles: - Autonomy - Beneficence - Non-maleficence - Justice

Ethical dilemmas: - End-of-life care - Resource allocation - Informed
consent

------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Emerging Medical Technologies

9.1 Artificial Intelligence in Medicine

Applications: - Medical imaging analysis - Clinical decision support -
Predictive analytics

Challenges: - Data bias - Explainability - Regulatory approval

9.2 Genomic Medicine

Technologies: - Whole genome sequencing - CRISPR gene editing

Ethical concerns include privacy and genetic discrimination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Long-Range Cross-Referencing Section (RAG Stress)

If a question asks: - “Which hormone mentioned in Section 2 affects
blood glucose?” → Insulin and glucagon - “Which disease in Section 1
involves dopaminergic neurons?” → Parkinson’s disease - “Which imaging
modality in Section 5 uses magnetic fields?” → MRI - “Which pharmacology
concept uses ADME?” → Pharmacokinetics

This section intentionally requires cross-document semantic retrieval.

End of Document

This document is intentionally verbose and concept-dense. It is suitable
for: - Chunk size experiments (200–2000 tokens) - Hybrid search (BM25 +
vector) - Medical-domain embedding evaluation - Hallucination resistance
testing
